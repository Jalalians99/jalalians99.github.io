            <p id="Masters">AOE's Master studies offer a flexible and individualised path to a master’s degree. The studies support the development of the students' expertise and advance their careers. To be eligible to apply, an applicant must have an appropriate bachelor’s or a higher degree and at least two years of subsequent work experience in a relevant field after completing the bachelor’s degree.
                <br>
                <br>


                The scope of the master’s studies is 90 ECTS and it takes 1.5 to 3 years to complete the degree. A master’s degree from a university of applied sciences delivers the same qualifications to a public office as a university master’s degree.
                <br>
                <br>
                The studies include compulsory studies, specialisation studies including thesis and free-choice studies. At the beginning of the studies, students make their Personal Study Plan based on their own development needs and future plans. Compulsory studies focus on research and development skills as well as competencies needed in developing organisations and leading change. Specialisation studies deepen the students’ professional competencies and students can choose their specialisation from three to eight options, depending on the chosen degree programme. The specialisation studies together with the thesis account for the majority of the master's studies.
